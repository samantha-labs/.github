## Hi there 👋
 * 🙋‍♀️ **Hello!** - My name is Samantha, and I use she/her pronouns! I'm a self-taught programmer, and currently a university student studying computer science. To better organize everything, I've setup an organization. You can see the main things I'm developing here.
 * 🌈 **Contribution guidelines** - how can the community get involved? - Contributions are lovely! Currently, contribution guidelines are in-progress. I will unfortunately be unable to evaluate contributons until then. Keep checking :)
 * 👩‍💻 **Useful resources**
   * [**Code of Conduct**](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
   * **Auto-generated API docs**: Every Node.js/TS repository auto-generates documentation for their API, so you can view their respective GitHub Pages.
